# MultiLanguage Invoice Extractor

This project uses **Streamlit** as the frontend and **Google's Gemini Pro Vision** model (via `google.generativeai`) to extract and understand information from multi-language invoices. Users can upload an invoice image, provide a prompt, and receive AI-generated responses based on the invoice's content.

## Project Overview

The **MultiLanguage Invoice Extractor** allows users to upload an image of an invoice and ask questions based on its contents. The application leverages Googleâ€™s **Gemini 1.5 flash** model to analyze the invoice and generate intelligent responses. It is built using **Streamlit** for the user interface and **PIL** for handling image uploads.
